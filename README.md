# **README.md**
Version 0.11 - Taxonomy_Create_and_Apply testing

In the works repo to store instructions for Gemini Web use. 

Target use-case = can have Gemini auto-reference this to pull instructions based on a prompt.

## **General Rules **

1 - Keep files as .txt, .md, .yaml, or .csv - other file types might create flags
2 - Can read .csv files as inputs from the repo, but output must be in the Gemini web-app
3 - Gemini's input limit is around 100mb (total), should keep things significantly smaller than that
